# Worktree Registry

Last updated: 2026-06-15

## Integration Owner

- Owner: main Codex agent in `C:\Users\raede\Desktop\dev\mapcreator`
- Integration branch: `main` closeout
- Base: current `origin/main` closeout after localization governance integration; implementation commit `4711b0dd` is the recovery point for product changes
- Live test/build owner: main Codex agent only
- Subagents: static inspection/review only; no live tests, dev server, or browser processes delegated

## Recommended Order

1. Review and rebase `codex/a11y-home-app-fix-20260615`; it now needs to absorb the integrated localization governance changes in UI/i18n/tests/dist.
2. Re-check recovery refs before recreating any historical worktree.

## Current Worktrees

| Worktree | Branch / HEAD | Base | Status | Dirty / hot files | Evidence | Overlap risk | Integration action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `C:\Users\raede\Desktop\dev\mapcreator` | `main` / current pushed closeout HEAD | current `origin/main` | active-main | user edit in `lessons learned.md` | Localization governance fast-forward merge reached `4711b0dd`; main validation passed with i18n audit, `tests.test_i18n_audit`, and `git diff --check`; registry/archive closeout was pushed | Green; preserve the user edit | No localization action remains; keep the user edit unstaged |
| `C:\Users\raede\Desktop\dev\mapcreator-a11y-home-app-fix-20260615` | `codex/a11y-home-app-fix-20260615` / `e3dfea57` | merge-base `9f0ef27a` with `origin/main` | ready-for-integration | shared UI, i18n, `dist/app`, and focused behavior tests relative to the older main | `git status --short --branch` is clean and tracks `origin/codex/a11y-home-app-fix-20260615`; changed files include `index.html`, `css/style.css`, sidebar/toolbar JS, locale data, `dist/app`, and behavior tests | Red; must rebase across integrated localization i18n/test/dist changes | Rebase onto latest `main`, run UI/i18n/Pages gates, then integrate if green |

## Current Overlap Matrix

| Pair | Risk | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| main -> a11y | Red | Direct overlap in `docs/active/_worktree_registry.md`, UI catalog/locales, `tests/test_i18n_audit.py`, and delivery-surface manifest/mirror files now that localization is integrated. |

## Recovery Records

These rows are branch or commit recovery indexes. They are historical references, not current worktrees.

| Former worktree | Recovery ref | HEAD commit | Removed at | Archived docs | Reopen condition |

## Active Notes

- Main checkout includes localization governance and retains an unrelated user edit in `lessons learned.md`.
- Main Codex agent owns validation commands; child agents are read-only static reviewers.
- Historical delivery packages live in their archived task/context docs; active registry keeps current worktree rows and recovery indexes.
- 2026-06-15: `codex/housekeeping-review-fix-20260615` was merged, archived, and cleaned locally. Remote branch remains as recovery record at `64ae29be`.
- 2026-06-15 localization governance: `4711b0dd` was fast-forward merged into main, validated on main, archived, pushed through the registry closeout, and cleaned from the active worktree list.
