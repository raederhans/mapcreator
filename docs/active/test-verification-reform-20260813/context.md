# Test Verification Reform Context

## Current truth

- Worktree: `C:\Users\raede\.codex\worktrees\ded1\mapcreator`
- Branch: `codex/p43-fast-verification-runner`
- Starting revision: `132e5b4542eab9e1fabe1d3861575bde458650f3`
- The prior core report planned 92 commands, passed the first 10, and stopped at `verify:test-console-allowlist`.
- `verify:core` currently lacks Git identity, per-command checkpoint, timing, and resume support.
- P4 phase verification already records initial/final SHA and tree and checkpoints command status, while resume and timing remain absent.
- The 339-test state-writer policy TAP took 6,139,150.8 ms; its six largest tests account for 99.12% and repeatedly scan the repository from one manifest test file.

## Decisions and deviations

| Time | Evidence or decision | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-13 | Adopt fail-closed resume keyed by clean Git identity, exact command plan, and SF-ATS invalidation. | Development retries may reuse unaffected evidence; final admission keeps one frozen-tree full run. |
| 2026-08-13 | Stop the orphaned `verify:core -> state-writer-policy` process tree by exact verified PIDs. | Prevented another duplicated multi-hour scan; all unrelated Playwright MCP processes were preserved. |
| 2026-08-13 | Use short simulated runner tests until the implementation stabilizes. | Shared runtime lanes remain available and expensive gates run once near closeout. |
| 2026-08-13 | Preserve only a contiguous passed prefix during resume. | The earliest invalidated or non-passed command starts the full suffix; plan/control/unmatched ambiguity fails closed. |
| 2026-08-13 | Use caller-owned in-process scan cache with cloned results. | Six manifest hotspots share one repository scan while each assertion receives isolated data; cross-process persistence stays out of scope. |
| 2026-08-13 | Add explicit command supersession for exact P4, TNO coverage, and Pages. | Composite gates remove their fully covered constituents from adaptive/supervisor execution plans. |
| 2026-08-13 | Batch metadata selector assertions by changed-file set. | The full metadata behavior file decreased from 21.13 s observed before batching to 8.80 s after batching on the same worktree session. |
| 2026-08-13 | Keep quick, focused, and full P4 policy TAP artifacts separate. | Development checks cannot overwrite the full admission report. |
| 2026-08-13 | Bind every passed command to its post-command clean identity and bind SF-ATS-reused evidence to both source and current applicability identities. | Identity drift, invalid final verdicts, and two-hop resume ambiguity fail closed. |
| 2026-08-13 | Preserve `verify:pages-dist` generation semantics and add `verify:pages-dist-and-drift` for single-build admission. | Existing dist-generation workflows stay compatible while core/adaptive/supervisor avoid the duplicate build. |
| 2026-08-13 | Restrict historical P4.2b/P4.2c supersession to commands they actually execute. | The current P4.3 policy gate remains present whenever historical exact evidence cannot cover it. |

## Live process ownership

| Process | Owner | Log path | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| core/P4/adaptive runner unit tests | root supervisor | `.runtime/reports/generated/test-verification-reform/` | short isolated commands only |
| full core, full P4 policy, browser, dist, performance | root supervisor | assigned before launch | held until candidate freeze |

## Handoff

Subagents provide read-only runner architecture and test-cost findings. The root supervisor owns all edits, `.runtime` outputs, Git state, long commands, and final verification.

## Next step

Freeze the candidate, then run the fresh full policy/core/Pages/browser/perf/TNO gates once under their explicit live-test owners. The final implementation loop completed with zero SF-ATS unmatched paths and an 89/89 bounded matrix.
